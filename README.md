# React workshop

This workshop is meant for people with (almost) no previous React experience. Before diving into the examples first please read the text below.

## Introduction into the React galaxy

React's website describes React as 

> A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

With React it's possible to develop JavaScript web applications *really* fast. 

React is component based and uses the [JSX](https://jsx.github.io/) language to define these components. Also it uses ES6 which you need to compile back to ES5 when you want to use your code in a production environment.

All in all, React is **really powerfull** library.

## React advantages

React has a lot of advantages but also some disadvantages. Let's go through some of the advantages first.

- **React makes it easy to reuse code**

  Since React is component based it's quite easy to reuse a component, especially when you use a pattern like [this](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0).

- **React is a open-source library**

  Open-source projects have a lot of benefits. For example, it's easier for the community to build additional tools. Also the quality of the projects code itself will be good since there are a lot of open-source contributors working on the project.

- **React has a big community**

  React is the most popular JavaScript library at the moment. This means the React community is really big which leads to a lot of questions/tutorials online. When you encounter a problem during your React development you can probably find the answer to your problem on Stack Overflow (or somewhere else on Google).

- **React uses a lot of JavaScript functionality but doesn't force you to use it aswell**

  As mentioned before, React uses JSX and ES6. This isn't mandatory tho. If you don't want to use JSX then don't. The same goes for ES6 since there's also a ES5 version of React.

  Besides all of this, React uses a lot of navite JavaScript functionality. So that means when you're getting better with React you're also getting better with JavaScript in general.
