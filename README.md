## Introduction into the React galaxy

React's website describes React as '*A JavaScript library for building user interfaces*'. With React it's possible to develop JavaScript web applications really fast. 

React is component based and uses the [JSX](https://jsx.github.io/) language to define them. Also it uses ES6 which you need to compile back to ES5 when you want to use your code in a production environment.

React has a lot of advantages but also some disadvantages. Letâ€™s go through some of the advantages first.
